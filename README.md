# Hospital-Management-using-C


PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
Write a program to implement HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM in C++ using a priority queue and an in-order List to store the items in the queue.
Create a class that includes the data items and the priority (which should be integer).The in-order list should contain objects. The items with highest priority appear at the beginning of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)
